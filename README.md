## Datasets


| Dataset | Description | Size |
|---------|-------------|------|
| [Original dataset](https://github.com/publiosilva/tcc-2/blob/master/unclassified-dataset.csv) | This is the original (unclassified) dataset. | 342 |
| [Oliveira dataset](https://github.com/publiosilva/tcc-2/blob/master/oliveira-dataset.csv) | The Oliveira dataset contains the same feature models as the original dataset but classified using Oliveira's approach. We use this dataset in the training of machine learning algorithms. | 342 | 
| [Silva dataset](https://github.com/publiosilva/tcc-2/blob/master/silva-dataset.csv) | The Oliveira dataset contains the same feature models as the original dataset but classified using Silva's approach | 342 |
